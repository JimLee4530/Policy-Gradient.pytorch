# Policy Gradient.pytorch

I just complete the HW3 in ADLxMLDS2017. I recommend it highly for anyone interested in it.

## ADLxMLDS2017

The repository is made to keep my works for the course: [Applied Deep Learning / Machine Learning and Having It Deep and Structured (2017 Fall)](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~yvchen/f106-adl/index.html), held by Prof. [Yun-Nung (Vivian) Chen](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~yvchen/) and Prof. [Hung-Yi Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~tlkagk/), National Taiwan University.

### Course Description

Learning the basic theory of deep learning and how to apply to various applications.

## How to run :

training policy gradient:

- `$ python3 main.py --train_pg`

testing policy gradient:

- `$ python3 test.py --test_pg`

## Requirements
Python 3.6.2 pytorch 0.3.0
